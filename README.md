# Fine-Tuning Llama-2-7b LLM for Question Answering - LLM QLoRA PEFT - Guanaco-Llama - Dataset

# Introduction
This project focuses on the fine-tuning of Llama-2-7b Large language model for the task of question answering. By leveraging techniques such as Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and Transfer Learning, the project aims to enhance the model's performance on the  Guanaco-Llama - Dataset, a diverse collection of questions and answers across various topics and complexities.

# Objective
The primary goal of this project is to fine-tune the Flan T5 Large model to effectively answer questions from the Guanaco-Llama-dataset using specific task instructions. This involves implementing PEFT and Transfer Learning methodologies to improve the model's understanding of questions and context, leading to more accurate responses.

# Code Implementation
1. Model Initialization: The  Llama-2-7b Large language model was initialized as the foundation for fine-tuning.
2. LoRA-based QLoRA Approach: The LoRA-based QLoRA approach was explored. This involved initializing the language model, enabling gradient checkpointing for memory optimization, and preparing the model for efficient fine-tuning using QLoRA.
3. Model Head Training: The model's head weights were set as trainable, enabling them to adapt to the specific task being fine-tuned.
4. raining Process: The model was fine-tuned for 250 epochs on a subset of the data.

# Concept of QLoRA
Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) is a method for model adaptation using quantization and low-rank approximation, leading to more efficient training and inference.
